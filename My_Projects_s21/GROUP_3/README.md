***== Quest received. Develop an src/graph.c program in C for creating graphs of functions defined by arbitrary expressions. To calculate the values ​​of expressions, use Dijkstra's algorithm for translating expressions into Polish notation. The program is assembled using a Makefile. The name of the build stage is all. The executable file must be stored at the root in the build folder named graph. ==***
