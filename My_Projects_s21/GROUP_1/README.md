***== Quest received. Develop an src/pong.c program for a two-player game, 
similar to Pong. To display the graphics, only use ASCII characters (with output 
to the terminal). You need to implement the step-by-step 
version using only the material of the course studied 
so far and the standard library.***

***== Quest received. You need to implement interactive version of the PONG (real-time game mode). Additional 
libraries can be used to simplify the processing of the players' actions and displaying symbolic graphics. The interactive mode code must be in the src/pong_interactive.c file. To implement the bonus part, you must implement the base part first. ==***
